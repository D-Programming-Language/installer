These files enable a one-command build of dmd rpms (for i386 and x86_64)
from the binary package archives at www.digitalmars.com.

Simply run:
    make

to build the devault version (2.062) and release (0).  Provided other
versions and releases do not stray outside of /usr/bin, /usr/lib,
/usr/include, /usr/share and /etc directors and only have /etc/dmd.conf and
/etc/bash_completion.d/dmd in the /etc directory it should be possible
to build them by passing make the appropriate values for VERSION and
RELEASE, e.g.

make VERSION=2.070 RELEASE=0

would build rpms from the 2.070 release 0 binary package archives at
www.digitalmars.com.

A note on building RPMs.
It is typically considered bad form to build rpms with a privileged user. There
are a lot of "rm -fr" statements, and if an environment isn't setup correctly,
catastrophic failure ensues. If you are building RPMs for the first time, follow
this guide to setting up a develpment environment.
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/A_Short_RPM_Tutorial#Development_environment

In short:
    yum install  @development-tools
    yum -y install rpm-build rpmdevtools rpmlint mock
    rpmdev-setuptree

The last command creates a ~/.rpmmacros file that roots your RPM build
environment in your user's home directory. After this, the Makefile should take
care of the rest.
