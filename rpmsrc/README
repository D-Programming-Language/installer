These files enable a one-command build of dmd rpms from a Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
machine. Simply run:
    make

A note on building RPMs.
It is typically considered bad form to build rpms with a privileged user. There
are a lot of "rm -fr" statements, and if an environment isn't setup correctly,
catastrophic failure ensues. If you are building RPMs for the first time, follow
this guide to setting up a develpment environment.
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/A_Short_RPM_Tutorial#Development_environment

In short:
    yum install  @development-tools
    yum -y install rpm-build rpmdevtools rpmlint mock
    rpmdev-setuptree

The last command creates a ~/.rpmmacros file that roots your RPM build
environment in your user's home directory. After this, the Makefile should take
care of the rest.
